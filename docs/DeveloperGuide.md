### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W15-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/tracko/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W15-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/tracko/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point).

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W15-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/tracko/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W15-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/tracko/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W15-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/tracko/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W15-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/tracko/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W15-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/tracko/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `tracko.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Order Management

Order management is one of two core features of TrackO alongside inventory management. These two features work together
to form the backbone of the application, allowing for efficient and reliable tracking of order and inventory data.

#### Overview

As per the Model diagram given [above]()(**_Ensure diagram consistency here_**), the application keeps track of one `OrderList`
at any point in time. This `OrderList` instance represents the container that keeps track of all order data in the system.

Currently, the application features 5 main operations that interact directly with the `OrderList`. They are represented by
the following commands:
* [`AddOrderCommand`](#Add-Order-Feature) - creates a new order to be added to the `OrderList`
* `FindOrderCommand` - filters and display matching orders from the `OrderList` based on provided keywords
* `ListOrderCommand` - display all order data from the `OrderList`
* `EditOrderCommand` - edit the data of an order from the `OrderList`
* `DeleteOrderCommand` - deletes an existing order from the `OrderList`

The order management feature is supported by the `Order` class, represented by the class diagram below.
![OrderClassDiagram](images/developer-guide/OrderClassDiagram.png)

The `Order` class encapsulates order-related data packaged in the following classes/attributes:
* `Name`, `Phone`, `Email`, `Address` - customer data related to the `Order`
* `ItemQuantityPair` - represents an ordered `Item` in the `Order`, with an accompanying `Quantity` that represents the amount of units of said `Item` ordered by the customer
* `LocalDateTime` - the time at which the order entry was created in the system
* `isPaid`/`isDelivered` - represents the completion status of the order (an `Order` is considered complete if both fields are true)

#### Add Order Feature

The add order feature allows the user to add an `Order` to be tracked by the system. 

##### Implementation

This feature is facilitated by the `AddOrderCommand`, which extends from the `MultiLevelCommand` class. 
The user will enter multiple rounds of input before an `Order` is successfully added to the system. 

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the add order mechanism behaves at each step. We assume that the user
has already added some inventory items to be tracked by the system, such that our initial state before the add order command 
is initiated, is illustrated as such.

Step 1. The user enters the following input into the UI's command box: 
`addo n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/311, Clementi Ave 2, #02-25`. This instantiates an `AddOrderCommand`, that references
a new `Order` which encapsulates the input customer data. This then sets the system to await and prompt for further input from the user.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** Upon any invalid inputs (invalid/missing prefixes or values), the UI will notify the user and provide a prompt for the correct input format) 
</div>

**_Object diagram to be added here_**

Step 2a. The user then enters `i/Pen q/3`, representing that the order requires 3 units (quantities) of 'Pens' to fulfill.
The system updates the instantiated command, by first having the `AddOrderCommand` stages the input item name and quantity for validation, 
using the `AddOrderCommand#stageForValidation()` method.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** Upon any invalid inputs (invalid/missing prefixes or values), the UI will notify the user and provide a prompt for the correct input format) 
</div>

**_Object diagram to be added here_**

Step 2b. The system searches the inventory items for an item that has a matching name. In this scenario,
we assume that the user has already added an `Item` with its `ItemName` value to be `Pen`, to the system's list of tracked items.
Hence, upon execution, a valid item was found based on the user's input item name, and the system adds a new `ItemQuantityPair` that
references the found item to the list of items ordered in the instantiated `Order`. 

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the user has entered an item name that cannot be matched to the system's inventory, the state will remain unchanged and the UI will notify the user and provide a prompt to re-enter inputs) 
</div>

**_Object diagram to be added here_**


Step 3. The user repeats Step 2 multiple times to fill up the instantiated `Order`'s list of ordered items.

**_Object diagram to be added here_**

Step 4. The user then enters `done` after inputting all the required order details. The system finally executes the command, adding the
built up `Order` to the `OrderList`. The system also no longer waits for additional input as the previously 'in progress' `AddOrderCommand`
is now completed.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The user can also choose to abort the command at any point after instantiating the command (Step 2 to 4), by entering 'cancel'
</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the add order operation works:

_**Sequence diagram to be added here**_

The following activity diagram below illustrates the general flow of the user's experience in adding an order.
![AddOrderActivityDiagram](images/developer-guide/AddOrderActivityDiagram.png)

##### Design considerations

Aspect: How add order command executes:
* **Alternative 1 (current choice)**: Multi-level command, with user inputting information multiples times between customer data and then subsequently multiple item and quantity inputs.
  * Pros: Better user experience. Users don't have to type out a very long command in one go to add an order.
  * Cons: Harder to implement.
* **Alternative 2**: Single level command, user inputs all required information in one long command.
  * Pros: Easier to implement.
  * Cons: Users have to type out a very long command, and multiple times if they were to mistype certain details and have to re-enter data.

**_More design considerations_**

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.
