TrackO is a **desktop app built for small business owners to help them manage customer contacts and orders, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you prefer and are fast at typing, TrackO can get your order and inventory management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

   Some example commands you can try:

    * **`listo`** : Lists all orders.

    * **`addi`**`n/Keychain` : Adds an inventory item named `Keychain` to the inventory list.

    * **`deleteo`**`3` : Deletes the 3rd order shown in the current list.

    * **`exit`** : Exits the app.

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `list` and `exit`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `list 123`, it will be interpreted as `list`.

</div>

### Adding an inventory item: `addi`

Adds an item to the list of tracked inventory.

Format: `addi n/ITEM_NAME [t/TAG]…​`

### Deleting an inventory item : `deletei`

Deletes the specified item from the list of tracked inventory.

Format: `deletei INDEX`
