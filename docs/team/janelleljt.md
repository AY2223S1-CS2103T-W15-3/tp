### Overview
**TrackO** is a desktop application that helps small home-based business owners manage their orders and inventory efficiently
in the form of an integrated solution built using Java with around 15 kLOC. The user interacts with the application via a
CLI, and the application responds with its GUI, created with JavaFX.
